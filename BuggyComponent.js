This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before it has mounted.  This often happens within lifecycle methods like `constructor` or `componentWillMount` (although componentWillMount is deprecated).  React Native components aren't fully initialized until after the `componentDidMount` method is called. Attempting to use `this.state` or `this.props` before this will result in `undefined` values.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, including crashes or silent failures.
